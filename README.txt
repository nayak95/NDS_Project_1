Author: Sanket Sadanand Nayak (UFID: 8895-9505)
All files are under Project-1.zip

The source code is under src folder in 'Project 1.zip' comprises of 3 .java file:
– 'Runner.java'
This contains the main() function from which the execution starts.
– 'HashTable.java'
Hashtable.java contains functions which implement the different types of Hash Tables in the question.
'multiHash()' implements multi-hashing table, 'cuckooHash()' implements cuckoo hashing table and 'dleftHash()' implements dleft hashing table.
– 'Entry.java'
This contains the Entry class which is used in above files to create Table Entries and Flows.

The folder also contains the output files in format: output_(type of Hash Table). They are as follows:
– 'output_cuckoo.txt'
– 'output_dleft.txt'
– 'output_multi.txt'

As per specifications, the first line of the above files give the number of flows in the table and subsequent lines contains the flow ids for each table.
